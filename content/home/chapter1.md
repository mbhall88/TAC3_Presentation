# Chapter 1

### Variant discovery in genome graphs

Develop algorithms and software for variant discovery using bacterial genome graphs, building on work of a previous student in the lab.

### Pan-genome

Bacterial genomes are incredibly diverse.

In an "open" pan-genome, such as *Salmonella enterica*, two individuals could share as little as 16% of their genes

---

### The single-reference problem

---

### Genome graphs

-   Uses a population reference graph (PRG) instead of a single, linear reference
-   PRG represents variation seen within a population
-   Two forms - local and pan-PRG

### Nanopore sequencing

Variant calling in its infancy (`medaka`, `nanopolish`, and Clair), but no extensive
benchmark has been completed (for Mtb)

---

### Genome Graphs + Nanopore

`Pandora` - pan-genome inference and **genotyping** with long-noisy or short-accurate reads from Rachel Colquhoun.

---

### `pandora map`

Infer consensus sequence for a *single* sample and genotype with respect to this consensus sequence

---

### `pandora compare`

Infer consensus sequence for a *collection* of samples and genotype with respect to this consensus sequence

---

## Limitation

`pandora` can only genotype based on variation within the graph

---

## Solution

The work in my first chapter outlines a method for removing this limitation and provides
an analysis of the gain in recall and precision by incorporating *de novo* variant discovery
into the `pandora` workflow.

# Variant discovery in a genome graph

#### Step 1: Finding candidate regions

---

#### Step 2: Enumerating paths through candidate regions

# Evaluation

---

## Empirical data

-   The main focus of both `pandora` and *de novo* evaluation
-   Use `pandora` to show the benefit of the genome graph approach
-   20 *E. coli* samples from different phylogroups
-   Compare to other variant callers - `snippy`, `samtools`, `medaka`, and `nanopolish` - using a variety of references

---

## Empirical data

Difficulty in evaluating is "truth"

-   Align each pair of genomes to get differences
-   Construct truth panel from these differences
-   Augment reference with variants and map truth panel
-   Calculate recall and precision

### Effect of basecalling model

---

### Precision

<img src="images/precision.png"  height="550" width="1100" style="border: none;">

---

### Recall

<img src="images/recall.png"  height="550" width="1100" style="border: none;">

---

### Outstanding work

-   Release preprint and submit paper (this month ðŸ¤ž)
-   Direct integration of *de novo* variants back into PRG
-   Some refinement of genotyping as a part of Chapters 2 & 3
