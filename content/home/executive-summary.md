# Aims of this PhD

1.  Develop algorithms and software for variant discovery using bacterial genome graphs,
    building on work of a previous student in the lab.
2.  Benchmark Nanopore versus Illumina SNP calling and show our
    algorithms meet the needs of clinical and public health users.
3.  Improve upon current whole-genome sequencing-based drug resistance
    prediction for *M. tuberculosis* using genome graphs.
4.  Curate a high-quality reference pan-genome for *M. tuberculosis*
    that includes a detailed map of the *pe/ppe* genes.
